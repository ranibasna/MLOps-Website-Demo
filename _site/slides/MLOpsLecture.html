## Data drift example

- The difference in distributions for each feature is measured and evaluated as statistically significant.

- One can use for example, Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests for numerical features and Chi-Squared test for categorical features, each with 95% confidence level.

- If the distributions are considered statistically significant, the feature is marked as having statistically significant drift.

## Model Bias and fairness: 

.pull-right[]
--

- Applications of AI systems can have a critical nature, such as medical diagnosis or prognosis, pairing people’s skills with jobs, or testing the eligibility of a person for a loan. 

--

- The impact of any bias in such systems can be widely harmful. Hence, an important property of future AI systems is **fairness** and **inclusiveness** for all. 

--

- This is specially important across **sensitive** features (gender, race, rare classes …). 

--

- Brainstorm for possible ways the system can go wrong (for example offensive words in nlp models) as well as ways to test these potential bias (multiple accuracy metrics unit tests) on different slices of the data as well as different business platforms.  

???

- The sensitive features depend on the context. Even for insensitive features, it’s important to assess the performance of the AI systems over the different subgroups to make sure we are aware of any underperforming subgroup before a model is deployed (In collaboration with business/product owners).

## Complex ML model and data pipeline  

--

- One situation is that an ML engineer is building **two** ml models. One for prediction a user profile (what are the interest of these users, average time spent on each session, dose she/he owns apple watch, does she/he like sport). Secondly, he also builds a recommender system that recommends products.  

--

- Now the problem is **doubled** and the complexity is higher. What if there are four of five ml models in the pipeline. How the change in the data will influence the production. What can we do about updating one model and leave the rest?

--

- How to insure that different data scientes working on different environment produce comparable results, How to insure a **reproducible** results comes from different data scientists. How to track who did what? Is the data transformation on the development branch can be **replicated** to the production environment? 

--

- Challenges: model versioning, model health checking, pipeline automation, trigger retrain for the whole pipeline. This is only for one ml model. Many companies are building several ML models.  

--

- The management of the multiple of models at once is a very cumbersome and challenging task which test the performance of the models at scale.

--

- With the use of MLOps paradigm, it naturally scales and manage multiple of pipelines of models in production. It is also possible to track the data lineage, model versions, training meta data and the model artifacts.

## MLOps, Overview on high level

--

1. **Software Issues** (the usual software development cycle, source code versioning, CI, CD, ... etc).

--

1. **Reproducibility issues** (Not being able to reproduce a specific version of the model results due to random initialization, stochasticity of the model, different packages version, package dependency, data changing. Solutions: data versioning, Conda, Docker). Therefore, in case of a problem, any attempt to roll back to an older version of a model might be impossible. This also, make the workflow reproducible across different OS and platforms.

--

1. **Reusability** (make sure that we do not need to rewrite the same workflow for similar projects, the code can only. be used by the writer of the code and can not be used by other data scientist) using packaging, for instance by employing the features exists in MlFlow project. 

--

1. **Error Prone**: (Training Serving Skew (For instance, A discrepancy between how you handle data in the training and serving pipelines.), Model Decay, Model Bias). This can be spoted by implementing a unit tests (from business point of view) as well as monitoring the model performance in general and on slices of the data.  

--

1. **Optimizing** the overall workflow by using **automation** techniques and experiments tracking. This means that allowing for more automated decisions when a retraining is triggered.(new data format, new features available, implementing a new model, adjusting an existing model). In addition, recording the artifacts of the different .big[experiments].

???

The goal here is to perform continuous training of the model by automating the ML pipeline; this lets you achieve continuous delivery of model prediction service. To automate the process of using new data to retrain models in production, you need to introduce automated data and model validation steps to the pipeline, as well as pipeline triggers and metadata management.

Characteristics

Rapid experiment: The steps of the ML experiment are orchestrated. The transition between steps is automated, which leads to rapid iteration of experiments.

CT of the model in production: The model is automatically trained in production using fresh data based on live pipeline triggers.

Experimental-operational symmetry: The pipeline implementation that is used in the development or experiment environment is used in the preproduction and production environment.

Modularized code for components and pipelines: To construct ML pipelines, components need to be reusable, composable, and potentially shareable across ML pipelines. In addition, components should ideally be containerized to do the following:

- Decouple the execution environment from the custom code runtime.
- Make code reproducible between development and production environments.
- Isolate each component in the pipeline. Components can have their own version of the runtime environment, and have different languages and libraries.
- Continuous delivery of models: An ML pipeline in production continuously delivers prediction services to new models that are trained on new data. The model deployment step is automated.

- Pipeline deployment: In level 0, you deploy a trained model as a prediction service to production. For level 1, you deploy a whole training pipeline, which automatically and recurrently runs to serve the trained model as the prediction service.

- CI is no longer only about testing and validating code and components, but also testing and validating data, data schemas, and models.

- CD is no longer about a single software package or a service, but a system (an ML training pipeline) that should automatically deploy another service (model prediction service).

- CT is a new property, unique to ML systems, that's concerned with automatically retraining and serving the models.
